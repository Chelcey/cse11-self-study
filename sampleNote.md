### BIG O NOTATION

## What is the main point of the Big O Notation?
> Describe the asymptotic behavior of functions (which is how fast the f(x) grows/declines)

## What is asymptotic behavior? 
> method of describing limiting behavior

## What is limiting behavior?
> limit is value that f(x) approaches as input approaches some value
> The limit of f(x), as x approaches a, is equal to L.
> means: As x gets closer to a, f(x) gets closer to L. 

## Why do we need to use Big O for?
> used to classify algorithms according to run time or space requirements

## Why do we need to classify algorithms according to run time or space requirements?
> Knowing how the algorithm works efficiently can add value to the way we do programming
> Can make the program behave in required optimal conditions

## What does optimal conditions means? 
> best level or state that it could achieve
