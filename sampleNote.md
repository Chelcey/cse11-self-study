# <span style="color:purple"> **BIG O NOTATION**</span>

## What is the main point of the Big O Notation?
> <span style="color:blue"> Describe the asymptotic behavior of functions (which is how fast the f(x) grows/declines)</span>

## What is asymptotic behavior? 
> <span style="color:blue"> method of describing limiting behavior</span>

<span style="color:blue"> > method of describing limiting behavior</span>

## What is limiting behavior?
> <span style="color:blue"> limit is value that f(x) approaches as input approaches some value</span>
> <span style="color:blue"> The limit of f(x), as x approaches a, is equal to L.</span>
> <span style="color:blue"> means: As x gets closer to a, f(x) gets closer to L.</span>

## Why do we need to use Big O for?
> <span style="color:blue"> used to classify algorithms according to run time or space requirements</span>

## Why do we need to classify algorithms according to run time or space requirements?
> <span style="color:blue"> Knowing how the algorithm works efficiently can add value to the way we do programming</span>
> <span style="color:blue"> Can make the program behave in required optimal conditions</span>

## What does optimal conditions means? 
> <span style="color:blue"> best level or state that it could achieve</span>
