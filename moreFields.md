# <span style="color:purple"> **(MORE) FIELDS**</span>

## What is the main point of (More) Fields?
> <span style="color:blue"> not sure right now</span>

## To write, tests, and run programs in a language called Java: 
> <span style="color:blue"> We will put a bunch of text into file with the extension `.java`</span>

## Given this program:
  ```
  class FirstExample
  {
    int theNumberFive = 5; 
    }
 ```
 ## Output:
 ```
 Tester Prima v.2.3
-----------------------------------
Tests defined in the class: FirstExample:
---------------------------
FirstExample:
---------------
new FirstExample:1(
 this.theNumberFive = 5)
---------------
No test methods found.
```

### Dissecting the program:
- <span stye="color:red"> **FirstExample**</span> <span style="color:dark green"> is the Test defined in the class</span>
- <span stye="color:red"> *The first line*</span> <span style="color:dark green"> is telling us the name of the tool we are using</span>
- <span stye="color:red"> *This output*</span> <span style="color:dark green"> is saying that an **object** was created and it **class** was `FirstExample`</span>
- 
> <span style="color:blue"> limit is value that f(x) approaches as input approaches some value</span>
> <span style="color:blue"> The limit of f(x), as x approaches a, is equal to L.</span>
> <span style="color:blue"> means: As x gets closer to a, f(x) gets closer to L.</span>

## Why do we need to use Big O for?
> <span style="color:blue"> used to classify algorithms according to run time or space requirements</span>

## Why do we need to classify algorithms according to run time or space requirements?
> <span style="color:blue"> Knowing how the algorithm works efficiently can add value to the way we do programming</span>
> <span style="color:blue"> Can make the program behave in required optimal conditions</span>

## What does optimal conditions means? 
> <span style="color:blue"> best level or state that it could achieve</span>
